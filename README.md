# Replication Exercise: Hit or Miss? The Effect of Assassinations on Institutions and War

Authors: Niccol√≥ Borri, Philipp Hilmbauer, Ramzi Chariag, Marton Vegh, Adam Vig

The repository contains code and data to replicate our project to the Empirical Political Economy class at CEU 2022 Winter.

### Abstract

The purpose of this report is to replicate the results from Jones and Olken
(2009) on democratization and conflict, to test their robustness and to augment
their analysis by adding new methods. In particular, we recreate the main
results of the original analysis, we add controls and fixed effects to examine
the robustness of their main results, and we employ an event study design to
investigate the dynamic aspects of the post-assassination period. Overall, the
results are largely reproducible and robust, however the effects cannot be found
when adding the dynamic component to the analysis

### Instructions for replicators

1. The replicator should set the working directory in `master.do` to the project folder.
2. Run `stata -b do master.do` from the terminal.
